Python Tutorials using the [manim](https://pypi.org/project/manim/) library.

Currently the only video is an [early draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWg1NRu8FSE) tutorial explaining how functions work. ([source](videos/function_intro.py))

Todo list:
* final proof of script
* decide if video should be split into shorter videos
* properly record audio (will probably end up being 20min at proper pacing)
* add additional animations (highlighting items as they are mentioned, arrows, underlines etc)
* sync animation with voice (build functionality to provide target timestamps?)
