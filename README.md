Python Tutorials using the [manim](https://pypi.org/project/manim/) library.

Currently the only video is an [early draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWg1NRu8FSE) tutorial explaining how functions work. ([source](videos/function_intro.py))

Goals
* visual approach, focusing on demonstration & analysis
* for beginners, appropriate primary school to adult, each topic starting simple and progressing to cover advanced aspects
* focus not only on programming principles, but also best practices (emphasis on readability)

Todo list:
* final proof of script
* decide if video should be split into shorter videos
* properly record audio (will probably end up being 20min at proper pacing)
* add additional animations (highlighting items as they are mentioned, arrows, underlines etc)
* sync animation with voice (build functionality to provide target timestamps?)
* add light background music

Potential topics
* variables
* immutable data types, variable unpacking
* mutable data types (list dict set)
* branching, looping
* functions
* arg lists and keyword args
* classes
* custom operators
* writing readable code
* writing and running(testing) code (beginner, principles, assert)
* formal testing (doctest, unittest)
* interpreting errors
* error handling
* custom exceptions
* decorators
* lambda functions
* modules/imports
* pip/virtualenvs
* regular expressions
* list comprehension
* context managers (with)
* generators
* f-strings
* PEP
* Library reference
* datetime, calendar, tzinfo
* logging
